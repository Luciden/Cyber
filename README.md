Some early code of a Lua2D game prototype I wrote in June 2013.

A game set around learning programming, cracking and social engineering (in a safe environment) by learning different (types of) operating systems and completing assignments.
Includes a simulator for operating systems and was supposed to feature procedural content generation of everything and perhaps multiplayer modes.

I would still like to develop this, if I have more ideas and the time for it.
