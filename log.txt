2013-05-30: I think this was the day I got the concrete (first) idea and
started to work some stuff out, using the bit of code I had from another idea.

2013-06-01: Started working on the computers, had basic functionality in order,
but some stuff didn't work yet, was just working on input.

2013-06-02:
* Input working with nice word wrap.
* Implementing basic commands for Simple OS.
* Had some ideas last night for how the puzzles will work (how information is
gained) and on how interacting with people works.
* Started on the conversation system.

2013-06-03:
* Work some more on displaying the conversation system. (Temporary Interace probably)
* Finished basic Conversation loop and Query translation.

2013-06-07:
* Creating an actual Map system.
* Created the basic teleportation structuring.
* Abstracting away Objects.
* Added (simple) doors.
* Add notion of time to the world.
